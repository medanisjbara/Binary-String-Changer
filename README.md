# Binary-String-Changer
this program is used to change a string inside a binary or a folder of binarries with another string. You can notice by reading the source code that I made it to make Termux binaries and libFile.so libraries more compatible with Pydroid 3 terminal by changing some paths inside the files (just for testing), you can actually use it to change any string into another string AS LONG AS THEY ARE THE SAME LENGTH 
you might find this practical in some cases, you might not .. but life is ultimately meaningless, so who cares.

# Here are some information you maybe didn't know:
1) I didn't make any installation condidate to this program .. it's just a python script. (i might make one, but i'm sure it's not necessary since no one will need it except nerdy non-programmers. probably because it's simple and the only advantage it has is on the automation level when it comes to nested folders and permission errors ect)
2) if you dealt with binaries before, you know you can't change a string within it with another string unless they're both the same size. However if you have a smaller string you can use a null bite. I'll add a flag to eable that option soon
3) you can't change a string within a binary file with a longer one (not without corrupting your file)
4) (for amateurs and dummy tunisians like myself) you can add strchng to your PATH (chang the name if you want) and use it as an installed linux command.
