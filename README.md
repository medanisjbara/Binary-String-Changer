# Binary-String-Changer
this program is used to change a string inside a binary or a folder of binarries with another string. You can notice by reading the source code that I made it to make Termux binaries and .so libraries more compatible with Pydroid 3 terminal (just for testing), you can actually use it to change any string into another string AS LONG AS THEY ARE THE SAME LENGTH
